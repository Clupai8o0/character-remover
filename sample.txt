The shoes had been there for as long as anyone could remember. 
In fact, it was difficult for anyone to come up with a date they had first appeared. 
It had seemed they'd always been there and yet they seemed so out of place. 
Why nobody had removed them was a question that had been asked time and again, 
but while they all thought it, nobody had ever found the energy to actually do it. 
So, the shoes remained on the steps, out of place in one sense, but perfectly normal in another.
It probably seemed trivial to most people, but it mattered to Tracey. 
She wasn't sure why it mattered so much to her, but she understood deep within her being that it mattered to her. 
So for the 365th day in a row, Tracey sat down to eat pancakes for breakfast.
Brock would have never dared to do it on his own he thought to himself. 
That is why Kenneth and he had become such good friends. 
Kenneth forced Brock out of his comfort zone and made him try new things he'd never imagine doing otherwise. 
Up to this point, this had been a good thing. 
It had expanded Brock's experiences and given him a new appreciation for life. 
Now that both of them were in the back of a police car, 
all Brock could think was that he would have never dared do it except for the influence of Kenneth.
"I'll talk to you tomorrow in more detail at our meeting, 
but I think I've found a solution to our problem. 
It's not exactly legal, but it won't land us in jail for the rest of our lives either. 
Are you willing to take the chance?" Monroe asked his partner over the phone.
